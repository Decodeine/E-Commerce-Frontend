# ecommerce-frontend
This is a modern React + TypeScript e-commerce frontend using Vite, Redux Toolkit, and React Bootstrap.
 

Features
--------
1. Fully operational shopping cart: adding & removing products, incrementing/decrementing quantity of an item in cart (limited by stock availibility), clearing cart.
2. Three-step checkout process with a selection of shipping address, delivery method and payment method (currently only card payments via [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) are supported).

## How to set up
